Momobot is a simple Discord Music bot including a live EQ

## Inspiration
This project was born because some friends wanted a simple Discord music bot with a bass boost function (EQ). The goal is / was to create a music bot with not too much effort. So the most logical thing to do was to use a simple powerful (already existing) music bot library. This project is based on [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)

## Goal
The goal of this Project is to have a simple, modified music bot to fit the requirements of servers run by me. Don'r expect to much

## Features
As stated this is a simple bot and should be no more. Expect standard music bot functionality. 

- Standard music bot functionality 
- Manipulate EQ on the fly
- Load and Save queues (at least up to 8 latest entries)
- more in the future
