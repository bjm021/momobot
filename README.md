Momobot is a simple Discord Music bot including a live EQ.

Checkout the [new version](https://github.com/bjm021/momobot2) rewritten completely to use the new Discord Bot API.
  
## Inspiration  
This project was born because some friends wanted a simple Discord music bot with a bass boost function (EQ). The goal is / was to create a music bot with not too much effort. So the most logical thing to do was to use a simple powerful (already existing) music bot library. This project is based on [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)  
  
## Goal  
The goal of this Project is to have a simple, modified music bot to fit the requirements of servers run by me. Don't expect to much  
  
## Features  
As stated this is a simple bot and should be no more. Expect standard music bot functionality.   
  
- Standard music bot functionality   
- Manipulate EQ on the fly  
- Load and Save queues (at least up to 8 latest entries)  
- more in the future  

## Getting Started
It is very easy to install this bot on your computer / server.
Refer to [Getting Started](https://github.com/bjm021/momobot/wiki/Getting-started) on our wiki.
> **Hint** You at least need JAVA Runtime 1.8.0_231 to run this bot
